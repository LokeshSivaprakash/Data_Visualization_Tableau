Project Objective

This project simulates real-world visualization challenges by requiring the design of a multi-dashboard Tableau Story that communicates a clear, data-driven narrative to a defined audience. The goal is not only to create charts, but to explain why specific visualizations, metrics, and structures are used, mirroring how analytics are presented in professional and executive settings.

Using U.S. airline delay data, the project analyzes operational performance across carriers and airports to identify key contributors to arrival delays. The final deliverable integrates three dashboards into a cohesive Tableau Story, supported by narrative context and analytical reasoning.

Project Topic

Airline delays are a major operational and customer experience issue in U.S. commercial aviation. Delays increase operational costs, disrupt schedules, waste fuel, and reduce customer satisfaction at a national scale. Understanding where and why delays occur is critical for improving efficiency and accountability across the airline industry.

This project explores airline delays by analyzing carriers, airports, geographic patterns, and delay causes, with a focus on identifying the largest contributors to average arrival delay time.

Research Questions

Which U.S. airline carrier experiences the highest average arrival delay time?

Which origin or destination airports have the highest average delays, and what geographic patterns emerge?

Which delay cause (weather, carrier, NAS, security, or late aircraft) contributes the most to overall delay minutes across the industry?

Analytical Approach

Built three dashboards, each aligned to one research question

Combined dashboards into a Tableau Story with a logical narrative flow

Applied:

Dynamic parameters for interactive analysis

LOD expressions for accurate aggregation

Conditional formatting to highlight performance extremes

Structured the story to move from carrier-level insights, to geographic airport patterns, and finally to operational impact by delay cause and airport tier

Deliverables

Tableau Story (.twbx) containing all dashboards and interactions

Written narrative (≤ 500 words) explaining dashboard logic, design choices, and analytical reasoning
