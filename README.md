# Data_Visualization_Tableau

Objective

This exercise is designed to strengthen practical skills in building and evaluating geographic visualizations using Tableau. The focus is on working with layered map data, correctly relating multiple geographic tables, and designing clear, interpretable visualizations that combine city-level and state-level information.

In addition to creating maps, the exercise emphasizes critical evaluation of visualization quality, including identifying design flaws and suggesting improvements.

Dataset

Source: Cities with the Most Cars

Link: https://www.copilotsearch.com/posts/cities-with-the-most-cars/

Geographic Levels:

City-level vehicle counts

State-level vehicle aggregates

Tasks & Scope
1. Data Preparation

Load and review the dataset in Excel

Connect the data in Tableau

Relate city and state tables using correct cardinality

2. City-Level Map Visualization

Create a symbol map showing cities with the highest number of vehicles

Size marks by aggregate number of vehicles

Use color to distinguish cities and states

3. State-Level Overlay

Add a second map layer using state-level data

Color states by aggregate number of vehicles

Correct layer ordering so state data does not obscure city data

4. Design Evaluation

Analyze the provided city–state layered map

Provide written criticism explaining why the visualization is poorly designed

Focus on clarity, visual hierarchy, and interpretability

5. Additional Visualization

Create a second map-based visualization

Display both city-level and state-level data

Apply sound visualization design principles to avoid confusion

Key Skills Practiced

Geographic data handling in Tableau

Multi-layer map creation

Data relationships and cardinality

Visual hierarchy and map design

Critical evaluation of visualization effectiveness
