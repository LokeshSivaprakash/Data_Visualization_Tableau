# Data_Visualization_Tableau

Clustering and Classification

Objective

This exercise is designed to reinforce foundational Tableau skills through independent analysis and visualization design. Similar to the previous exercise, the focus is not on following step-by-step instructions, but on determining how to build effective visualizations. You are responsible for selecting the most appropriate charts, metrics, and filters (when applicable) to clearly answer the analytical questions.

Analytical Questions

Using the Bookstore dataset, this project answers the following questions through Tableau visualizations:

Relationships Across Performance Metrics

Are there correlations between checkouts, print run size, book review ratings, and sales volume?

Discount Patterns

Are there identifiable patterns in how discounts are applied across books, genres, or time?

Publication Timing

When are most books published?

Are there any notable anomalies or outliers in publication dates?
