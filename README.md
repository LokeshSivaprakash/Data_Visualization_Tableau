# Data_Visualization_Tableau

Objective

This exercise is designed to strengthen practical skills in using Level of Detail (LOD) expressions in Tableau. The goal is to apply INCLUDE, EXCLUDE, and FIXED LOD calculations to answer analytical questions that cannot be solved using standard aggregations alone. The exercise emphasizes careful data interpretation, thoughtful metric design, and clear presentation tailored to the intended audience.

Dataset

Dataset: Sample – Superstore

Format: Excel (Sample - Superstore.xlsx)

The dataset includes sales, customers, products, categories, states, and regions.

Display:

All 49 states

Categories

State-level category sales

National category sales (constant across states)
