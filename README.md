# Data_Visualization_Tableau

Descriptive_Statistics_Table_Calculations

Objective

This exercise is designed to strengthen foundational Tableau skills by requiring independent analytical thinking and visualization design. Rather than following prescriptive steps, the project challenges the analyst to determine the most effective visualizations, calculations, and filters needed to answer real-world business questions using the Bookstore dataset.

The focus is on selecting appropriate data, defining metrics clearly, and presenting insights in a way that is both accurate and easy to interpret.

Analytical Questions Addressed

Using Tableau visualizations, this project answers the following questions:

Author Debut Age

Who was the youngest debut author and who was the oldest?

Debut age is calculated as the author’s age at the time their first book was published.

Sales Price Calculation

How should sales price be calculated when discounts are applied inconsistently?

The analysis accounts for both discounted and non-discounted sales to ensure accurate revenue measurement.

Pareto Principle in Sales

Do book sales follow the Pareto principle (i.e., does a small percentage of books account for the majority of sales)?

Visualizations are used to assess sales concentration and distribution.

Key Skills Practiced

Analytical problem framing

Calculated fields and derived metrics

Visualization selection and design

Handling conditional logic (e.g., discounts)

Interpreting distributions and concentration patterns
