# Data_Visualization_Tableau

Repository Overview (Main Branch)

This repository serves as a central hub for multiple Tableau visualization projects completed as part of graduate-level coursework in data visualization and analytics. Each project is developed and maintained in its own dedicated Git branch to preserve clarity, version control, and project independence.

The main branch does not contain analysis files or dashboards. Instead, it provides documentation and navigation to each project branch, allowing reviewers to easily explore individual assignments without confusion.

Project Structure

Each project is organized in a separate branch, containing:

1. Tableau workbooks (.twbx)
2. Supporting datasets (when applicable)
3. Project-specific README.md documentation
4. Exports of key visualizations

This structure mirrors real-world analytics workflows, where projects are isolated while sharing a common repository.
