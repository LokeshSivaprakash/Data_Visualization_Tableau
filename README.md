# Data_Visualization_Tableau

Objective

This exercise is designed to strengthen foundational Tableau skills by emphasizing independent problem-solving and visualization design. Unlike earlier exercises, no step-by-step instructions are provided for creating the visualizations. Instead, the analyst is responsible for determining which data to use and selecting the most effective visualization techniques to clearly answer each question.

Analytical Questions

Using the Bookstore dataset, this project addresses the following questions through Tableau visualizations:

Seasonality in Sales and Checkouts

Are there seasonal trends in sales or checkouts?

Do specific titles or genres exhibit seasonal fluctuations?

Genre, Format, and Price Trends

Are there observable relationships between genre, format, and price?

Do certain genres or formats tend to be priced higher or lower?

Author Effort vs. Book Success

Do authors who spend more time writing produce more successful books?

Is writing time associated with higher page counts or stronger performance?
