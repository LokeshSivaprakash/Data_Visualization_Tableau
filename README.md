# Data_Visualization_Tableau

Objective

This exercise focuses on building an interactive Tableau dashboard to evaluate sales performance for an office supply company. Acting as an analyst reporting to the CFO, the goal is to analyze order and sales target data and create visualizations that help management determine whether sales targets were met and where performance is strong or weak.

The project emphasizes dynamic parameters, calculated fields, and user-friendly design to support executive decision-making.

Dataset

File: Tableau Exercise Data Set.xlsx

Data Includes:

Orders

Product pricing and discounts

Sales targets

Time-based performance metrics

Analytical Tasks
1. Top-N Product Analysis

Create a dynamic Top-N products visualization where popularity can be defined in two ways:

Sales Revenue

Order Quantity

Key Requirements:

Create a calculated field for Sales Revenue that accounts for discounts

Discount is a percentage reduction from price

Use a parameter to toggle between:

Sales Revenue

Order Quantity

Allow the user to choose the value of N

Ensure the chart title and axis labels update dynamically based on the selected parameter

2. Monthly Profit Control Chart

Create a time-series visualization showing monthly profit across the dataset.

Key Requirements:

Create a Profit calculated field

Define each month as:

Profitable

Not Profitable

Use a parameter slider to allow users to adjust the profitability threshold

Color data points based on profitability status

This visualization functions as a control chart, enabling management to quickly identify months that underperform relative to expectations.

Key Skills Practiced

Calculated fields (revenue, profit, conditional logic)

Dynamic parameters and parameter-driven titles
